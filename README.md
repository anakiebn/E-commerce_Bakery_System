Online Bakery System

It's Basically an online shopping website but this time for bakery products, like cookies, cakes muffins etc.

Description

I got this project of from Mecer-inter-ed 2023 June, where i got hands on experience working with Java SE8 and JEE fundamentals and we only has a month to finish it.
This was a group of project, so i've worked on the service, controller and the view parts. We use MVC model, for our controller we used Servlets to handle Http requests.
for our view we utilized JavaScript, JSPs, CSS, Html and Bootstrap.

Features

- Login : A user can create an account, upon registration they will receive an email to confirm their registration also if they exist in the systemm the will login.
- Order : A customer must be able to place an order, view their products in a cart and place payment.
- Add To Cart: When we don't have enough stock, a product will be out of stock, therefore it can't be placed to cart, otherwise they can add as many products they desire.
- Manage stock: Admin has features to add, delete, update stock ingredients, products, recipes, manage orders, users and see reports.

What i learned

- Got to use JSP,  writting java code inside html file was amazing. 
- Using Servlets  on my controller helped provide my data for the view, making the backend communicate with the frontend was just a thing i needed to learn.
- was also amazing learning about sessions and cookies in java
- Using JDBC , the preparedStatements and learning SQL gave a deep understanding of data storage,
